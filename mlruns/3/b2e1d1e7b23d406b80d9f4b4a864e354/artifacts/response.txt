Sure! MLflow experiment tracking is like keeping a detailed notebook for your machine learning projects. When you build and test different models, you try many settings—like changing the learning rate, number of layers, or data preprocessing steps. MLflow helps you record all these details automatically:

- **What parameters you used** (e.g., learning rate = 0.01)
- **What code or model version you ran**
- **The results or metrics you got** (e.g., accuracy = 85%)
- **Any output files or models you saved**

This way, you can easily compare different runs, see which settings worked best, and reproduce your experiments later. It’s like having a smart logbook that organizes all your machine learning experiments in one place.
