Sure! MLflow experiment tracking is like keeping a detailed notebook for your machine learning projects. When you try different models, settings, or data, MLflow helps you record:

- **What you tried** (like model type, parameters)
- **What happened** (like accuracy, loss)
- **Artifacts** (like saved models or plots)

This way, you can easily compare different runs, see which worked best, and reproduce your results later. It’s a tool that organizes and tracks your experiments so you don’t lose track of what you did.
