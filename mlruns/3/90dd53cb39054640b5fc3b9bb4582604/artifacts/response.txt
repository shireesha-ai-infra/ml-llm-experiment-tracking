Sure! Modern AI, or artificial intelligence, is like teaching computers to think and learn a bit like humans do. Instead of just following exact instructions, these computers can look at lots of information, find patterns, and make decisions or predictions on their own. For example, AI helps your phone understand your voice, recommends movies you might like, or even helps cars drive themselves. It’s all about making machines smarter so they can help us in many different ways.
